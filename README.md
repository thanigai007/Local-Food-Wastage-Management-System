# Local-Food-Wastage-Management-System
Food waste is a critical global problem with environmental, economic, and humanitarian consequences. A large portion of edible food is discarded daily by providers such as restaurants, supermarkets, and grocery stores, even as millions of people struggle with hunger and food insecurity. Bridging this gap requires a system that can efficiently redirect surplus food to those who need it the most.

The Local Food Wastage Management System is a web-based application developed to mitigate food waste at the community level by connecting food providers with receivers such as NGOs, community kitchens, and individuals. Developed using Python and Streamlit for the front-end, and MySQL for the backend, the system offers a user-friendly interface for managing food donations, claims, and data analytics.

Key functionalities include:

Viewing and managing available food listings

Claiming food by verified receivers

Visual dashboards for food type trends and donation volumes

CRUD operations for database tables

A query engine for insights and learning (Learner Queries)

The platform encourages food sustainability, community collaboration, and effective resource utilization. By digitizing the surplus food donation process, the system promotes environmental consciousness and reduces food insecurity, contributing positively to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 2: Zero Hunger and SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production).

🔹 Short Abstract (For Slides or Summary)
